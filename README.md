### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am an ambitious and hardworking student in Hexlet college.
I deeply want to step by step build a successful career in IT. For one
year now I have been actively interested in Python programming using
Django framework, JavaScript, Algorithms and Data Structures,
and problem-solving on resources such as leetcode. Attention to detail and patience. Self-motivation and independence. Resilience and constant willingness to study are my main keys to success!
